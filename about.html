                <h2>Services offered by the internet</h2>
                <h3>How it functions</h3>
                <p>It works by using a technique called packet switching  and by relying on standardised networking 
                    protocals that all computers can interprate.
                </p>
                <p>Since computers connect to each other within networks also all connect with each other
               , one computers can talk to another computer in a faraway network  thanks to the internet.
                 This makes it possible to rapidly exchange information between computers acrose the world.</p>
                 <p>Computers connect to each other and to the internet via wires,cables, radeo waves and
                    other types of networking infustructures.All data sent over the internet is translated
                    into pulses of light or electricity,also called "bits", and then interprated by the receiving computer.
                 </p>
                 <p>The wire ,cables, and radeo waves conduct these bits at the speed of light. the more bits that can 
                    pass over these wires and cables at once, the faster the internet works.

                 <h2>The fundamental concepts in which the internet functions</h2>
                 <h3>There are two types mainly packets and protocals</h3>
                 <h2>packets</h2>
                 <p>In networking , a packet is a small segment of a larger message. each packet containg both data and 
                    information about that data. The information about the packets
                    contents is known as the "header", and it goes as the front of the "head" and it   goes at the front
                    of the packet so that the receiving machine knows What to do with the packet.To understand the purpose
                    of a packet header,think of how some consumer products come with assembly instructions.
                    When data gets sent over the internet , it is first broken up into smaller packets, which are translated
                    into bits.The packets get  routed to their destination by various networking devices such as routers
                    and swiches. When the packets arive at their destination , the receiving device reassembles the packets or
                    use or display the data.
                    
            
                </p>
                <p>Compare this process to the way the united states statue of liberty was constructed. The statue of liberty
                    was first designed and built in france. However , It was too large to fit onto a ship, so it was too 
                    large to fit onto a ship , so it was shipped to the united states in pieces, along with instructions
                    about where each pieces reassembled,them in new york.

                </p>
                <p>While this took a long time for the stutue of liberty sending digital information in smaller pieces 
                    is extremely fast over the internet.For instance, a photo of the statue of liberty stored on a web
                    server can travel across the world one packet at a time and load on someone's computer within a millisecond.</p>

                   <p> Packets are sent across the internet using a technique called packet switching.
                    Intermediary routers and switches are able to process packets independently from each other, without accounting
                    for their source or destination.This is by desighn so that no single connection dominates the network. If data
                    was sent between computers all at once with no packet switching, it could occupy multiple for minutes at a time essentially,
                    only two people would be able to use the internet at a time instead of an almost unlimited number of people, is the case 
                    in reality.

                   <h2>protocols</h2>
                   <p>Connecting two Computers, both of which may use differnt hardware and run differnt software, is one of the main
                    challenges that the creative of the internet had to solve. It requires the use of communication techniques that
                    are understandable by all connected computer, just as two people who grew up in differnt parts of the world may
                    need to speak a common language to  understand each other.
                   </p>
                   <p>This problem is solved with standardised protocols .In networking a protocal is a standardised way of doing
                    certain actions and formatting data so that two or more devices are able to communicate with and understand
                    each other.
                   </p>
                   <p>There are protocols for sending packets between devices on the same network (Ethernet),for sending packets
                    from network to network (Ip),for ensuring those packets successfully arive in order (Tcp), and for formmatting 
                     data for websites and applications (Http). In addition to these foundational protocals, there are also 
                    protocals for routing, testing ,and <u>encryption.</u> there are alternative to the protocals listed above for
                        differnt types of content-for instance, streaming video  often uses (UDP) instead of TCP .
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>Because all internet -Connected computers and other devices can interpret and other devices can interprate
                        and  understand these protocals, the internet works no matter who or what connects to it.</p>
